    <shortDescription>
        A 3 Dimensional representation of points in space for a given data set. 
    </shortDescription>
    
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>This node plots three columns (x, y, z variables) in 3 dimensional space displayed as a moveable, exapandable and rotating graph. It also allows for the colorization
         of data points based on their cluster membership, as determined by a previous clustering process. Currently, this node will colorize data clustered by K-Means, Fuzzy C-Means 
         and DBSCAN nodes. When operating on K-Means clustered data, you may also pass the prototypes table to the second In-Port to graph the cluster prototypes in 3D space and alter
         their appearance so they stand out from the table data. Other options are described below.
         </intro>
        
         <tab name="Standard Options">       
        <option name="Column (Variable) Selection">Choose three columns from the data table to serve as the X, Y and Z axis variable in the 3D Graph</option>
        <option name="Is the data Clusetered">If the data has been previously clustered by a K-Means, Fuzzy C-Means or DBSCAN node, then selecting this option
        will enable the full suite of clustering options and allow for colorized cluster representation in the graph</option>
        <option name="Cluster Type"> Select the method of clustering used on the data table. This will enable different settings depending on which type of clustering 
        has been performed (such as filtering data whose cluster membership belongs to the "Noise" cluster for DBSCAN). Be aware, that incorrectly selecting the cluster type
        may cause issues during execution.</option>
        <option name="Number of cluster">Provide the number of clusters found in the custering operations previously performed. NOTE: if providing DBSCAN data, do NOT include 
        the "Noise" cluster in this total (ex: 4 clusters and 1 "Noise" cluster have been identified, enter 4"). </option>
        <option name="Prototype table provided"> Select this option if the method used (and also identified above) is K-means clustering AND you have provided the matching prototype
        table at the 2nd In-Port. This table will have been created as an Out-Port table by the K-Means clustering node.</option>
                </tab>

        <tab name="View Options">
            <option name="Plot all real data points">Select this option if you wish to have 1 : 1 data points on the graph to rows of data in the provided table.
            Unselect if you wish to specify the number of points plotted in the next option.
            </option>
            <option name="Number of plotted points">Enabled when the previous option is not selected, this option allows you to set the number of rows from the data table you
            would like represented as points on the graph. NOTE: If you are providing a DBSCAN clustered data set and have correctly provided the requisite settings, the number of points
            plotted will skip members of the "Noise" cluster if you have selected to not plot them and indlude them in the count is that option is enabled.</option>
            <option name="Plot members of the 'Noise' cluster">The option is enabled when you have indicated your data table was clustered using the DBSCAN algorithm and selecting this
            option will plot members of the "Noise" cluster, whereas un-checking this option will only plot members of defined clusters to allow for more distinct visual groupings.
            </option>
            <option name="Point size">Select the size (in pixels) of each individual point on the 3D graph.</option>
            <option name="Prototype Point Size">Enabled when you have indicated a K-means clustered data set and provided a prototype table, this view option allows you to specify the sice
            of the prototype points on the graph to allow for better distinction between data and prototypes.</option>
            <option name="Prototype Point Color">Enabled when you have indicated a K-means clustered data set and provided a prototype table, this view option allows you to specify the
            color of the prototype points on the graph to allow for better distinction between data and prototypes.</option>

        from a clustering node if you wish to color the data by cluster.</inPort>
